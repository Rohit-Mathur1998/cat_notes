# Cat Notes Backend

This is the backend for the **Cat Notes** application, which allows users to create, read, search, and delete notes. The application connects to a MongoDB database and uses RESTful API endpoints for communication.

## Features

- Create new notes
- Retrieve all notes
- Search notes by title or content
- Delete notes by ID
- API request counting and metrics

## Requirements

Before starting the project, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)  
  Download Node.js: [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- **MongoDB**
  - You can run MongoDB locally or use a cloud-based service like **MongoDB Atlas**.
  - Make sure MongoDB is running and accessible from your local machine.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rohit-Mathur1998/cat_notes.git
cd cat-notes-backend
2. Install Dependencies
Once you've cloned the repository, you need to install the project dependencies. Inside the project directory, run the following command:

npm install
This will install all the necessary libraries and packages listed in the package.json file, including:

express for handling HTTP requests.

mongoose for connecting to MongoDB.

cors for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

dotenv for managing environment variables.

3. Configure Environment Variables
To configure your environment, you'll need to create a .env file in the root directory of your project. This file stores important configuration settings, such as your MongoDB connection URI and the server port.

Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following content:

MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/catnotes
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI: The connection string to your MongoDB instance. By default, this is set to a local MongoDB instance running on localhost:27017, with a database called catnotes. If you're using MongoDB Atlas or another service, replace this with your own MongoDB URI.

PORT: The port the server will run on. The default is 5000, but you can change it to any available port on your machine.

4. Start the Server
After setting up the environment variables and installing the dependencies, you can start the server by running the following command:
npm start
This will start the backend server, and it will be available at http://localhost:5000.

5. Testing the API
Once the server is running, you can test the API using tools like Postman or cURL by making requests to the following endpoints:

POST /api/notes
Create a new note.

Request Body: { "title": "Note Title", "content": "Note Content" }

Response: Newly created note details.

GET /api/notes
Retrieve all notes.

Response: A list of all notes.

GET /api/notes/search?q={query}
Search for notes by title or content.

Query Parameter: q (the search query string).

Response: Matching notes.

DELETE /api/notes/{id}
Delete a note by ID.

Path Parameter: id (the note ID to be deleted).

Response: Confirmation of deletion.

GET /api/metrics
Retrieve server metrics, such as the total number of API requests made.

Response: { "httpRequests": <number of requests> }

Additional Features
API Request Counting: The server includes middleware to track the number of API requests made to the backend. You can view the total number of API calls by accessing the /api/metrics endpoint.
```
